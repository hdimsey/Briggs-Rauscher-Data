This is a copy of the experimental data taken from Figure 4.5. of 'An introduction to Nonlinear Chemical Dynamics' by Irving Epstein and John Pojman (with permission). The original data is from 'Mechanistic study of oscillations and bistability in the Briggs-Rauscher reaction' by De Kepper and Epstein (1982). The true experimental data nolonger exists so this data is reconstructed using WebPlotDigitiser.
